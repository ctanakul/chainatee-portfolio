			  <p><b><font size="5">Overview</font></b></p>
			  <p><font size="4">The goal of this project is to operate Sawyer, the manufacturing robot by Rethink Robotics, to catch a ball thrown at him. The hardware used are Sawyer and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stereo_camera">a stereo camera</a>, with RGB and depth sensor. The system functions in 3 main parts, detecting the ball position, predicting the final position of the ball and the moving the arm with Jacobian based endpoint control algorithm to catch the ball. The system is run via ROS and codes are written in Python.</font></p>

			  <p><b>Part 1: The Ball Detection System</b></p>
	
			  <p>Just like human needs eyes to see objects, Sawyer needs an RGBD camera to detect the position of the ball. Here, we use Asus Xtion Pro run with <a href="http://wiki.ros.org/openni2_launch">openni2</a> package. They can process a stream of RGB image and depth image separately. The RGB image is the multi-dimensional array of type uint8 with the size of x*y*3 specifying the color of each pixel based on RGB. The depth image is the matrix of type uint8 with the size of x*y. The number of each array represents the physical distance of that pixel from camera frame.</p>
                          <p><img class="img-responsive" src="assets/img/portfolio/work06_rgb_and_depth_img.png" alt=""></p>
			  <p>Our strategy for detecting the ball is to get the pixel at the center of the ball in RGB image and then access the depth of it in depth image.</p>
			  <p>To get the pixel in RGB image, the color of the ball is tracked, the ball is then enclosed, and the approximated center is sent out. The image is first converted from ROS message to multi-dimensional array. Then, to get rid of the area with non-interesting color, we use <a href="http://docs.opencv.org/2.4/modules/core/doc/operations_on_arrays.html">cv2.inRange</a>. At this point, the important area might not be fully extracted. Thus, the image is further converted into HSV image to keep only a portion of specified HSV range with the same function. Noise or small non-interesting area is <a href="http://docs.opencv.org/2.4/doc/tutorials/imgproc/erosion_dilatation/erosion_dilatation.html#erosion">eroded</a> and the left important area, the ball, is <a href="http://docs.opencv.org/2.4/doc/tutorials/imgproc/erosion_dilatation/erosion_dilatation.html#dilation">dilated</a>. The unmasked portion is then enclosed by a <a href="http://docs.opencv.org/2.4/modules/core/doc/drawing_functions.html#circle">circle</a> whose center pixel is outputted into <a href="http://docs.ros.org/api/image_geometry/html/python/#image_geometry.PinholeCameraModel.projectPixelTo3dRay">projectPixelTo3dRay</a> to get the unit vector pointing to that pixel from the camera center then it is scaled up by the depth of that pixel from depth image to get the approximated ball position. Users can adjust the RGB and HSV range and the size of eroding and dilating kernel with <a href="http://docs.opencv.org/2.4/modules/highgui/doc/user_interface.html?highlight=createtrackbar#createtrackbar">trackbars</a> provided with the algorithm.</p>
			  <p>Right now you may notice that the position of the ball is relative to the position of the camera, but it was not relative to Sawyer. Exactly!!, we have to find that relative position.</p>
                          <p><img class="img-responsive" src="assets/img/portfolio/work06_frames.png" alt=""></p>
			  <p>To find P<sub>sb</sub> = T<sub>sc</sub>.P<sub>cb</sub>, we first get T<sub>sc</sub> from <a href="http://wiki.ros.org/tf/Overview/Using%20Published%20Transforms#lookupTransform">lookupTransform</a> and P<sub>cb</sub> from the position of the ball we just got. Therefore, we can find P<sub>sb</sub>. To visualize the position of the ball, we send <a href="http://wiki.ros.org/rviz/DisplayTypes/Marker#The_Marker_Message">Marker</a> message to RVIZ, a <a href="http://wiki.ros.org/rviz/DisplayTypes/Marker#Line_Strip_.28LINE_STRIP.3D4.29">line strip</a> links two detected positions, each represented by a <a href="http://wiki.ros.org/rviz/DisplayTypes/Marker#Sphere_.28SPHERE.3D2.29">sphere</a>.</p>

			  <p><b>Part 2: the final position prediction</b></p>
			  <p>The projectile calculating algorithm estimates the future position of the ball by fitting the 3D parabola plot with RANSAC. The plot is being updated through throwing.</p>
			  <!-- <p>The <a href="https://github.com/ctanakul/sawyer-catching-ball/blob/master/src/sawyer_catch_ball_calc.py#L29">projectile calculating algorithm</a> estimates the future position of the ball from the first few positions in 3D at the beginning of the throw. Every two positions can be used to find initial velocity and launch angle in horizontal and vertical plane to estimate the future position of the ball.</p> -->
			  <!-- <p>In order to check the precision of the system without running real robot, the predicting position is <a href="https://github.com/ctanakul/sawyer-catching-ball/blob/master/src/ik_controller_full_system.py#L207">simulated as a frame</a> in RVIZ to compare between the final position of the ball in physical and simulated world. </p> -->

			  <p><b>Part 3: Catching the ball with Jacobian based endpoint control algorithm</b></p>
			  <p>Approximately, a throw spends a second. Consequently, the arm must be moved within a second. Before every move, the hand will be moved to home position by sending the dictionary containing names and joint positions as a parameter in <a href="https://rethinkrobotics.github.io/intera_sdk_docs/5.0.4/intera_interface/html/intera_interface.limb.Limb-class.html#set_joint_velocities">set_joint_velocities</a> function of <a href="https://rethinkrobotics.github.io/intera_sdk_docs/5.0.4/intera_interface/html/intera_interface.limb.Limb-class.html">class Limb of intera_interface</a>. The <a href="http://math.ucsd.edu/~sbuss/ResearchWeb/ikmethods/iksurvey.pdf#page=9">damped least square inverse kinematics</a> is used to find joint velocity for each joint in robot arm while moving. We need to specify damping constant that is “large enough so that the solutions for joints are well-behaved near singularities, but if it is chosen too large, then the convergence rate is too slow.” This method focuses on minimizing the chance of having the set of joints that move end-effector to the unreachable point. </p>

<!-- 			  <p>The frequency of published pointcloud is adjusted to be at 30 Hz. The assumed number of 3D positions needed for future position estimation is 5 positions which will take about 15 milliseconds. Since the estimated time used in a throw is about 1 second, the time for the arm to move to catch the ball is about 85 milliseconds. For simplicity, the planar area for moving hand is specified. This area can be found by moving the arm and timing the total time used.<p> -->
<!-- 			  <p>Before every move, the hand will be moved to home position by sending the dictionary containing names and joint positions as a parameter in <a href="http://api.rethinkrobotics.com/baxter_interface/html/baxter_interface.limb.Limb-class.html">move_to_joint_positions</a> function of class Limb.

<!-- 			  <p>The approximate area that the hand can be moved within 85 milliseconds is 30 x 30 cm square on the right side and a semicircle with 30 cm radius on the left side of the home position.</p> -->

<!-- 			  <p><b>Present development</b></p> -->
<!-- 			  <p>The present challenge is to get the correct 3D position of the ball from pointcloud. Normally, pointcloud can return the 3D position quite accurate. However, for moving object such as a thrown ball, the stereo-correspondence may fail which will return depth of NaN (Non-applicable Number). With NaN depth, the 3D position of the ball cannot be found which lead to the loss of data for trajectory prediction.</p> -->
<!-- 			  <p>However, with the assumption that some pixels around such problematic pixels may not fail in returning depth, the author finds depth of every 30 x 30 pixels around the center and find the average depth of all. Outlier depths which may be returned from those points not being part of a ball such as wall will be filtered out. This process can return depth for every pixel specified as the center of the ball.</p> -->
<!-- 			  <p>To check the accuracy and analyze the data, the coordinate of pixels specified as center of the ball and the 3D position of the ball are <a href="https://github.com/ctanakul/sawyer-catching-ball/blob/master/src/detect_color_full_system.py#L134">plotted through time</a>.</p> -->
